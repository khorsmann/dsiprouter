Install Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Proxy SIP Traffic Only (Don't Proxy audio (RTP) traffic) 
- Proxy SIP Traffic and Audio when it detects a SIP Agent is behind NAT
- Proxy SIP Traffic, Audio and it configures the system to work properly when the PBX's and dSIPRouter are behind a NAT.

The steps to install each configuration is below.  Note, there are one line versions of the install in each section below.  The average install time is between 4-9 minutes depending on the resources on your vm/server.

Install (Don't Proxy audio (RTP) traffic)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::
 
  apt-get update 
  apt-get install -y git curl
  cd /opt
  git clone https://github.com/dOpensource/dsiprouter.git
  cd dsiprouter
  ./dsiprouter.sh install
|

One Line Version: 
::
    apt-get update;apt-get install -y git curl;cd /opt;git clone https://github.com/dOpensource/dsiprouter.git;cd    dsiprouter;./dsiprouter.sh install


Once the install is complete, dSIPRouter will automatically start MySQL, Kamailio and the UI.

Install (Proxy audio (RTP) traffic)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to proxy RTP traffic then add the -rtpengine parameter. The command to install dSIPRouter and the RTPEngine would be:


::

 apt-get update
 apt-get install -y git curl
 cd /opt
 git clone https://github.com/dOpensource/dsiprouter.git
 cd dsiprouter
 ./dsiprouter.sh install -rtpengine

|


One Line Version: 
::

 apt-get update;apt-get install -y git curl;cd /opt;git clone https://github.com/dOpensource/dsiprouter.git;cd dsiprouter;./dsiprouter.sh install -rtpengine


Once the install is complete, dSIPRouter will automatically start MySQL, Kamailio and the UI.  But, you will need to reboot the physical server or virtual machine for the RTP Engine to start.  This is a known `issue <https://github.com/dOpensource/dsiprouter/issues/42>`_ .
